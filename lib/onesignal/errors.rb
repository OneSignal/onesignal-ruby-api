module OneSignal
  # Sentinel error message strings the OneSignal API can return. Each
  # constant equals the literal message the server emits, so you can test
  # membership against ApiError#error_messages (e.g. NO_TARGETING_SPECIFIED).
  #
  # Note: 200-status sentinels such as NO_SUBSCRIBERS arrive on a successful
  # response, not via the exception accessor — read the response's errors
  # field for those.
  module Errors
    # HTTP 403 | retryable: no | emitted by: any API-key-authenticated endpoint (REST or Organization key) | note: Generic auth-failure message the public api.onesignal.com edge returns for any invalid or mismatched key — REST or Organization — so a single sentinel covers both. Supersedes the Rails-monolith INVALID_REST_API_KEY / INVALID_USER_AUTH_KEY strings, which the public host no longer returns verbatim. Note the double space after 'denied.'
    INVALID_API_KEY = 'Access denied.  Please include an \'Authorization: ...\' header with a valid API key (https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/en/keys-and-ids#api-keys).'.freeze
    # HTTP 400, 404 | retryable: no | emitted by: POST /notifications/{id}/history, POST /notifications/{id}/messages, GET /notifications/{id} (export) | note: Verified live 2026-06-16: GET /notifications/{bogus-uuid} returns 404 with this exact message.
    NOTIFICATION_NOT_FOUND = 'Notification not found'.freeze
    # HTTP 200 | retryable: no | emitted by: POST /notifications | note: Returned with HTTP 200 OK (id is empty), not an error status. The flagship case for the errorMessages accessor — lets callers distinguish a sent notification from a no-op without parsing the polymorphic 200 body.
    NO_SUBSCRIBERS = 'All included players are not subscribed'.freeze
    # HTTP 400 | retryable: no | emitted by: POST /notifications | note: Verified live 2026-06-16: a no-targeting POST /notifications returns 400 with this exact message.
    NO_TARGETING_SPECIFIED = 'You must include which players, segments, or tags you wish to send this notification to.'.freeze
    # HTTP 503 | retryable: yes | emitted by: any endpoint (pgbouncer rejection) | note: Transient DB/pgbouncer failure — the canonical retryable sentinel.
    SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE = 'Service temporarily unavailable'.freeze
